# JavaScript?

This theme has almost no JavaScript. It includes a ~950 byte `.js` file with the logic for the light/dark mode switch which can be disabled by setting `theme_switcher = false` in the `config.toml` file.

KaTex support, which requires JavaScript, can be activated for specific posts.

Other than that, it's a fast site with HTML and CSS. Just the way (most of) the web should be :-)
