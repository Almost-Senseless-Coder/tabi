## JavaScript?

This theme has no mandatory JavaScript. Optionally, it can load a minimal amount to add some features that are impossible to achieve with HTML and CSS:

- **Light/dark mode switch**. Enabled by setting `theme_switcher = true`. (~900 bytes)
- **One-click copy of code blocks**. Enabled by setting `copy_button = true`. (~700 bytes)

These two settings can be applied in the `[extra]` section of your `config.toml` file.

[KaTeX support](@/blog/markdown.md#katex), which requires loading a 274 KB JavaScript file, can be activated for specific posts. This can be done by setting `katex = true` in the post's `[extra]` section of the post's front matter.

Other than that, it's a fast site with HTML and CSS. Just the way (most of) the web should be :-)
